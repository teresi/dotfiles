    requires bash configs:
    export PATH+=:/home/teresi/perl5/bin/
    PERL5LIB="/home/teresi/perl5/lib/perl5${PERL5LIB:+:${PERL5LIB}}"; export PERL5LIB;
    PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT="/home/teresi/perl5${PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT:+:${PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT}}"; export PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT;

    then it will always run *first*, and then $(_bin): $(_src).git *should* resolve properly

[ ] refactor vundle
    if ca-certificates are not installed, use install_git_cert.bash
    add a target that checks for ca-certificates, and installs it?
    maybe just always install it?

[ ] refactor xsel

[ ] compile zathura
    [ ] compile gtk3 https://docs.gtk.org/gtk3/building.html

    + need?: nghttp2 libnghttp2-dev libssl-dev

[ ] compile libss / libssl-dev?

[ ] add command to check for existence of a library

- improve npm detection,
    + npm might be installed but can't be detected b/c bashrc hasn't run
    + this also might happen somehow where bashrc is sourced but still can't be detected b/c nvm.sh is missing?

- remove requirement for libssl-dev for cmake?
    + ./configure -DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=OFF
    + actually neovim needs tls/ssl support in cmake...
