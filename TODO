[ ] rework nvim dap for rust
[ ] test whether the `repo` rule is more reliable as a prereq, not an order only prereq
[ ] update uses of gpg to the pattern used in libreadline, or create a function for it
[ ] stop on failure for `all` target (no -ik)

[ ] targets do not always rebuild if git repo is pulled up
    add phony 'repo' target prior to $(_src)/.git,
    remove 'repo' as a prereq to $(_src)/.git
    then it will always run *first*, and then $(_bin): $(_src).git *should* resolve properly

[ ] add wget
[ ] install cpanm
[ ] cmake is missing some perl modules on redhat
    see cookbook, install_perl_deps

- improve npm detection,
    + npm might be installed but can't be detected b/c bashrc hasn't run
    + this also might happen somehow where bashrc is sourced but still can't be detected b/c nvm.sh is missing?

- add gcc

- add gpg?
    + https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/git/postlfs/gnupg.html

- add libiconv (for gettext if missing glibc)
    + https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

    _gnu_pub_url=https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
    _gnu_pub=/tmp/gnu-keyring.gpg
    curl -C - -o $_gnu_pub $_gnu_pub_url
    gpg --import $_gnu_pub

- move from psutil to sysstat / mpstat in tmux cpu info
    + mpstat -P ALL  # show usage per core
    + https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat
    + remove need for pip as prereq for tmux (no longer need psutil)

- remove requirement for libssl-dev for cmake?
    + ./configure -DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=OFF
    + actually neovim needs tls/ssl support in cmake...

- explore these bash scripts
