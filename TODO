- add libtool, remove autotools-dev as dependency
- update bison Makefile
- improve npm detection,
    + npm might be installed but can't be detected b/c bashrc hasn't run
    + this also might happen somehow where bashrc is sourced but still can't be detected b/c nvm.sh is missing?
- add gcc
- add gpg
    + https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/gettext-0.22.5.tar.gz.sig
- add libiconv (for gettext if missing glibc)
    + https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
- add option for local/bin to another dir (e.g. data)
- separate download/verify from compile to remove wget/curl dependency
- add screen
- refactor TMUX
    - separate libevent & ncurses from tmux
    - enable libevent compile
    - enable ncurses compile
- add fc-cache
- add wmctrl
- add xdotool
- add xsel
     + https://github.com/kfish/xsel
- add xclip
- add sysstat
    + https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat
- move from psutil to sysstat / mpstat in tmux cpu info
    + mpstat -P ALL  # show usage per core
    + https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat
    + remove need for pip as prereq for tmux (no longer need psutil)
- add libssl
    + does compiling this also install headers/libs so we dont' need libssl-dev?
- remove requirement for libssl-dev for cmake
    + ./configure -DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=OFF
    + actually neovim needs tls/ssl support in cmake...
